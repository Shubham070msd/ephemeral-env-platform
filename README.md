# Ephemeral Environment Deployment Platform

## üß© Objective

This project is a DevOps platform that allows developers to **deploy feature branches on-demand** into **temporary AWS environments**, primarily for QA testing. Each environment is **self-destructing after 24 hours** of inactivity, or can be destroyed manually.

---

## üöÄ Features

- CLI to input GitHub repo URL and branch name
- Checkout and deploy code from the specified branch
- Deploy infrastructure to AWS using Terraform
- Provision ECS Fargate + ALB + VPC with 2 public subnets
- Output a live deployment URL
- Auto-destroy inactive environments (simulated)
- Manual destroy option
- Clear evidence and documentation

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS ECS Fargate**, **ALB**, **Route Tables**, **VPC**
- **Bash scripts** for CLI, deploy, auto-destroy
- **GitHub** as source repo
- **nginxdemos/hello** used as sample container image

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

---

### 1. Deploy a New Branch

To deploy a feature branch to an ephemeral environment, run the following script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-from-branch.sh
# Enter repo URL and branch when prompted
```

### 2. Manual Cleanup Instructions

To manually remove the deployed environment, run the following script:

```bash
./scripts/destroy-env.sh
```

#### Manual cleanup logic

This script goes into the Terraform folder and runs `terraform destroy -auto-approve`, which deletes all the AWS resources created during deployment. You can use this anytime to manually clean up the environment.

---

### 3. Auto-Destruct Script

To automatically destroy environments after a timeout period, run:

```bash
./scripts/auto-destroy-check.sh
```

#### Auto-destroy logic explanation

When a new environment is deployed, the current time is saved in a file called `deployed_at.txt`.  
A script named `auto-destroy-check.sh` checks this file to see how much time has passed.  
If more than 24 hours (or a set time) has passed, the script runs `terraform destroy` to delete all the resources automatically.  
This simulates the idea of auto-destroy after inactivity.
